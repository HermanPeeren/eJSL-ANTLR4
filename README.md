# eJSL-ANTLR4
Port of eJSL, the modelling language in JooMDD, from Xtext to ANTLR4. JooMDD: https://github.com/thm-mni-ii/JooMDD

ANTLR4 has a runtime in PHP as target language. With this port I want to make the definition of a eJSL-model and the generation of Joomla-extensions from that model available in PHP as Joomla extension.
